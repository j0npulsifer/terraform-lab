*tl;dr*kubernetes*admission*control*

This is the flow that K8s takes to admit a workload into a cluster

    [ Authentication ]   ->   [ Authorization ]    ->    [ Admission Control ]   ->   ALLOW/DENY
           WHO                      WHAT                          psp
         are you?             do you want to do?           does your workload
                                                         align with our policy?
