* Lab Design

- Source the `hack/utils.sh` script by running `.`hack/utils.sh`
- Folders in serial `00-bootstrap`, `01-secure-cluster` ...
- Each folder has a `tf/` directory containing terraform configuration
- Each folder contains a `README.md` with instructions for the lab

*Today:*

- familiarization with the lab repo and branches (`master` and `00-bootstrap`)
- deploy a GKE cluster and supporting infrastructure from code!

* Getting Started
